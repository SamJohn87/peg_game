# Peg Game

The Triangle Peg Game is a classic brain-teaser where the objective is to jump pegs over one another, removing them until only one peg remains.
My project involved the design and development of a digital version of the Triangle Peg Game.
This project was developed with **Vanilla JavaScript**.
